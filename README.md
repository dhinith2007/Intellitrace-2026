IntelliTrace: Real-Time Cross-Channel Mule Detection Using Graph Intelligence

📌 Overview

IntelliTrace is a real-time fraud detection platform designed to identify coordinated money mule networks operating across multiple digital banking channels such as Mobile Apps, Web Portals, UPI, Wallets, and ATM systems.

Traditional rule-based fraud engines analyze transactions in isolation, making them ineffective against high-velocity, multi-hop fund transfers. IntelliTrace solves this problem by unifying multi-channel transaction logs into a structured Entity Graph and applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to detect relational fraud patterns at network level.
